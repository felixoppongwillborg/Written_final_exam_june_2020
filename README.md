## Necessary steps to take in order to get a feature done.

### Idea
First of all when you have an idea, it's very important to understand what your idea is all about and for whom it's for.
You first need to figure out what the need is for this feature/app is to exist.

### planning
I would say that the actual planning of the idea is the most important thing.
Everybody in the team needs to understand every step of the "product", Not the actual implementation, but what will happen and what the ambition is with every step.
At the planning stage, it's important to ask critical questions. This is the only way for you as a team to figure out If the features you're discussing is actually necessary to implement or at what stage you should implement it.
To plan out styling in advance will save you a lot of headache in the end. As much planning you can do when it comes to layout, colors ect is great.

Writing user stories is a huge part of the planning and will help you understand what to implement and a lot of times how to implement it, if the user stories is written well.
It's important to keep the user stories quite small, so when you submit pull requests it's easy to do code reviews.
When it becomes too much code you set yourself up for failure since it's easier to merge unnecessary code.

When the user story is written it's always a good idea to start planning your sprint and vote for the stories you're gonna implement for that sprint.
Unless everybody has a unanimous vote everybody needs to voice their opinion regarding why they voted in this way.
Nobody will get extra points for sitting quiet. Every concern needs to be brought to the table.


### implementation.

When everybody knows the application good, it's time to start coding.
Make sure that you always stay in the scoop of the user story.
Branch of properly. Try to always pair code as much a possible.
Communication is more or less everything between the team.
To hold scrum meetings is a great way of getting everybody in the same loop of what's going on in the project.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
In between features, it's always good to test your application.
